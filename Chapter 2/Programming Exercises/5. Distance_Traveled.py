### 5. Distance Traveled
Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the inter-state can be calculated with the following formula:
                                      
                                      Distance = Speed x Time

A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:

• The distance the car will travel in 6 hours

• The distance the car will travel in 10 hours

• The distance the car will travel in 15 hours
'''

speed = 70
distance_1 = speed * 6
distance_2 = speed * 10
distance_3 = speed * 15

print(f'The distance the car will travel in 6 hours is:{distance_1} miles ')
print(f'The distance the car will travel in 10 hours is:{distance_2} miles')
print(f'The distance the car will travel in 15 hours is:{distance_3} miles')
