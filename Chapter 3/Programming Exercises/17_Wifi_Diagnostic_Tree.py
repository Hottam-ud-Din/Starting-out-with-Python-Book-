17. Wi-Fi Diagnostic Tree
Figure 3-19 shows a simplified flowchart for troubleshooting a bad Wi-Fi connection. Use 
the flowchart to create a program that leads a person through the steps of fixing a bad 
Wi-Fi connection. Here is an example of the programâ€™s output:

Reboot the computer and try to connect.

Did that fix the problem? no Enter

Reboot the router and try to connect.

Did that fix the problem? yes Enter

Notice the program ends as soon as a solution is found to the problem. Here is another example of the program's output:

Reboot the computer and try to connect.

Did that fix the problem? no Enter

Reboot the router and try to connect.

Did that fix the problem? no Enter

Make sure the cables between the router and modem are plugged in firmly.

Did that fix the problem? no Enter

Move the router to a new location.

Did that fix the problem? no Enter

Get a new router
